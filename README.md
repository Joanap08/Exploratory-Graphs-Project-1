# Exploratory-Graphs-Project-1
Exploring plots packages in R

Extract the Day 1 and Day 2 of February 2007 

To examine what is happening in the data.

1. First we will create an Histogram of the Global Active Power and learn How to extract the plots using dev.copy

2. Secondly we will create the Line plot and use strptime for those dates and check the Global Active Power accross those days.

3. We will follow the same line plots to check the behavior of the Energy in the 3 Sub meters available.

4. At last we will present all 2 of the plots previously done in the steps above and also represent how the voltage behaves accrossing those 2 days as well as Global reactive Power.
